# K-Nearest-Neighbors-KNN-Algorithm-for-Iris-Dataset
This repository contains an implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm applied to the Iris dataset. The KNN algorithm is a simple yet powerful classification algorithm that predicts the class of a data point based on the classes of its nearest neighbors.
