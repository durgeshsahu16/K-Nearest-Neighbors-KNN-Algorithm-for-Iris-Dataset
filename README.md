# K-Nearest-Neighbors-KNN-Algorithm-for-Iris-Dataset
This repository contains an implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm applied to the Iris dataset. The KNN algorithm is a simple yet powerful classification algorithm that predicts the class of a data point based on the classes of its nearest neighbors.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset is a widely-used dataset in machine learning and consists of 150 samples of Iris flowers. Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The samples belong to one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica. The Iris dataset is often used for classification tasks and serves as a benchmark dataset in the machine learning community.

## Implementation

The KNN algorithm is implemented using Python and the scikit-learn library. The implementation includes the following steps:

1. Loading the Iris dataset: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file or an online source, such as the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
2. Preprocessing the dataset: The features and the target variable are separated to prepare the data for training and testing.
3. Splitting the dataset: The dataset is split into training and testing sets to assess the model's performance on unseen data.
4. Data preprocessing (optional): Data preprocessing techniques like scaling or normalization can be applied to enhance the model's performance.
5. Creating a KNN classifier: A KNN classifier object is created with a specified number of neighbors.
6. Fitting the model: The KNN classifier is trained on the training set by fitting it to the features and target variable.
7. Making predictions: The trained model is used to make predictions on the test set.
8. Evaluating the model: The accuracy score is calculated by comparing the predicted labels with the true labels of the test set.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, the following dependencies are required:

- Python (version 3.6 or later)
